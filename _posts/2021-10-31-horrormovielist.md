Lo and behold a creeptastic post because 'tis the spooky season. Now that I have that out of my system, let's get right down to it. Just so you know, bringing the list down to 10 was harder than anything that I've ever done. Now onto the list.

>The Haunting of Hill House

This series is my all time favourite and a permanent fixture on my Netflix continue to watch row. Although Hill House isn't in your face scary, the narrative is beautifully woven together making the series a treat to watch. I wouldn't do anyone the disservice of discussing the plot line hear. Instead I would sit in the corner and glare at you until you turn Netflix on and start watching this masterpiece. You're welcome in advance!

>The Conjuring part 1 & 2

Being the proud host of my very own horror podcast, freakuency, there was no way I wouldn't have stumbled across the likes of everyones favourite demonologists: Ed and Lorraine Warren. If you've heard about the Warrens and love all things scary, chances are that you're already familiar with the conjuring Universe. These movies are based on real life cases that the Warrens investigated. If there's one thing that makes a scary movie horrifying, it's the based on a true story label and this franchise ticks that creepy little box.

>The Grudge (Japanese Version)

The first time I saw this movie was when I was 12 years old. I was staying with my aunt and older cousin, and my mother had strictly forbade me from doing anything stupid like playing scary games or watching anything remotely horror. Keeping her warning in mind, I did the only logical thing: watched a Japanese horror movie with an unfamiliar title. The repercussions? Let's just say that I couldn't look at a flight of stairs without freaking out for weeks afterwards

>Haunted: Latin America + original

<img src='/images/haunted.png'>

This Netflix original series has two parts. One based in the US and the other in Latin America. In the series, a bunch of people gather around and talk about their "real life" paranormal encounters. Most of the stories are unverified. I would take everything I see through a grain of salt. Real or not it does make for a fascinating binge.

>Buzzfeed unsolved supernatural (all seasons)

![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oeHLAHeEDz8C8mGjK/giphy.gif)

Buzzfeed unsolved supernatural is a YouTube series wherein the two hosts Ryan and Shane visit "haunted locations" to conduct investigations into the question - "Are ghosts real?" Whether you are a believer, a skeptic or somewhere else on this spectrum, the series has got you covered. Its spooky ambience and mostly hilarious narrative make for a perfect weekend binge. The series is currently in its final season and honestly, I'm still trying to figure out how I'll survive after it ends...

Dec 2021 Update: Ryan and Shane have recently announced a new series "Ghost Files" all set to release of their channel- Watcher on YouTube. Yay!

>House of Secrets, The Burari deaths

<img src='/images/houseofsecrets.png'>

Being a devout horror fan I grew up watching all sorts of gory movies and series. I am desensitised to this content to a degree that almost nothing phases me anymore. This series, however, proved me wrong. House of secrets is a Netflix documentary centred around the mass suicide debacle that took place in New Delhi (my city of residence) back in 2018. The series presents some real footage of the aftermath and the bizarre truth behind the incident as well as the media frenzy surrounding it. Despite having being aware of this incident, something about the portrayal of events in this documentary chills you to the core.

>The Final Girls

<img src='/images/finalgirls.png'>

This one's a slasher with an actual storyline. It's incidentally the only one of its genre to make the list. I watched this movie recently and honestly? I love the sound track the most. The story line is cool with a ton of extremely gruesome scenes thrown in to boot. The Final Girls is about a teenager who loses her mom in a car accident and a couple of years after this tragedy, finds herself trapped in a cult classic horror movie the mom starred in when she was younger. It ends on a cliffhanger though so proceed with caution.

>The Shining

Need I say anything more?

>Annabelle Comes Home

![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/9AILkQPZ2uTumtsfto/giphy.gif)

As the name suggests this movie is about Annabelle and her home: the Warrens' house in Monroe, Connecticut. This movie is like Mecca for horror lovers and features many of the famed cursed artefacts that find their home in the very real occult museum. The thought that these artefacts reside in the same dimension as me is enough to give me the creeps!

>The Ring

![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/orU5I0JOQ83d9bHFZZ/giphy.gif)

The ring chronicles the escapades of Samara- the well ghost. It can best be described as a result of the found footage craze in the horror movie industry during the 00s. In the ring universe, if you find Samara's creepy little tape and watch it, she materialises in front of you through the screen and drags you into whatever little hole she crawled out of.  The GIF is a snippet of that tape. Don't worry thought, this one's not based on any real story. At least I think it isn't...


And I'm all out of recommendations. Proceed at your own risk.
