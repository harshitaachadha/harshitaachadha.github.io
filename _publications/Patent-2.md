excerpt: '<mark style="background-color: #d5c5fa">Patent</mark> PINNAC is a women's security provision that capitalizes on one's instinct to defend to create a protective mechanism. Developed over a period of one year (2019-2020), PINACC was filed to be patented in October of 2020. It has since been published in the gazette of The Department of Promotion of Industry and International Trade, Intellectual Property Office, Government of India (page-172) and the application is currently under consideration.

In an ideathon hosted by the IEEE society's New Delhi chapter in March of 2019, my team and I embarked on a mission to develop a unique security provision for women. Recognizing the limitations of traditional security alert apps in real-life situations, we were determined to create something more effective.

After numerous brainstorming sessions and discarded ideas, we stumbled upon the concept that would become PINNAC. Rather than relying on software solutions, we took a different approach by designing a discreet hairpin with a hidden mechanism for self-defense.

PINNAC utilizes substances that are unfortunately often used to harm women and repurposes them as tools for escape and protection. The prototype features a concealed piston and injection system within the prongs of the hairpin. A simple push of a button deploys a needle, immobilizing attackers by targeting their vital points.

Months of dedication were poured into perfecting the PINNAC prototype. In October of the following year, we filed for a patent, which has since been published by the Intellectual Property Rights Authority of India. We eagerly await its official grant, knowing that it has the potential to enhance women's security.

PINNAC represents a shift away from the traditional narrative of women as helpless victims. It showcases the power of innovation and resilience in providing practical solutions for self-defense. Our goal is to empower women, offering them a tangible tool to protect themselves in times of crisis. The creation of PINNAC has been a transformative journey. It has allowed us to challenge conventional notions and develop a practical solution that empowers women. PINNAC is a testament to the importance of innovation in creating a safer and more secure world for everyone.
