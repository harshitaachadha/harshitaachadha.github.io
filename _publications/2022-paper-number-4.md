**Abstract:**
Emerging as a class of network, wireless sensor network (WSN) remains highly resource-constrained. The primary concern revolving around WSN systems is the energy consumption. The current study employs a cross-layer design approach toward the development of an energy-efficient routing protocol to address this concern. The proposed is titled the PRRP (Position Responsive Routing Protocol) system. The design of the proposed methodology is such that it serves to minimize the energy that is consumed in the respective distance nodes relative to the given networks. The study also involves a critical evaluation of how the proposed PRRP protocol behaves and performs in relation to the parameters of the network’s energy consumption, throughput, and network lifetime, focusing on the individual basis for the respective data packets. From the results, the research has established that, upon being analyzed and also benchmarked relative to well-known models such as CELRP and LEACH protocols, PRRP comes with significant improvements in the WSN systems concerning energy efficiency. As such, PRRP is confirmed to steer marked improvements in WSNs’ overall performance.
