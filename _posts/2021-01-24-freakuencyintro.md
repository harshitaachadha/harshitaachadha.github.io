Hey there, fellow thrill-seekers! Prepare yourselves for a spine-chilling revelation in this captivating post. Drumroll, please Introducing my wickedly exciting project for 2021: my very own podcast!

As the clock struck midnight in December 2020, a daring friend and I decided to unleash our inner eccentrics and embark on a podcasting adventure, delving into the bone-chilling realms that have captivated us for far too long. Brace yourselves, for this podcast, launching in April, shall become a sacred sanctuary for horror aficionados.

Behold the frequency of the freaks! We've planned to grace your ears once every fortnight, with an extra monthly treat to keep you on the edge of your seat. In our regular episodes, we shall regale you with tales of supernatural phenomena, haunted locations, true crime cases, and urban legends, among an endless list of thrilling topics. But wait, there's more! Our bonus episodes shall dive deep into the dark abyss of Reddit, scouring for the most bloodcurdling and gory stories to narrate. And when the stars align, we'll sprinkle in our own eerie encounters to spice things up.

Now, you may be wondering how a science-minded soul like myself stumbled upon the supernatural labyrinth. Well, let me enlighten you. I grew up under the influence of a parent whose adoration for horror rivals that of Lorraine Warren herself. However, don't mistake me for a true believerâ€”I'm simply a masochistic enthusiast who enjoys sending shivers down my own spine, only to spend sleepless nights contemplating probabilities and jumping at the faintest of sounds.

Our episodes are crafted meticulously, ensuring they're packed to the brim with bone-chilling content guaranteed to freeze you in terror. Clocking in at a tantalizing 20-25 minutes, they'll leave you craving more. And fear not, for our podcast shall be available on all major streaming platforms, from Apple Podcasts to Buzzsprout and Spotify, granting you easy access to your darkest fears.

So, my fearless friends, we've reached the end of this unapologetically self-promoting post. All I implore you to do is give our podcast a chance, see if our eerie vibes resonate with your frequency (pun intended!). For further bone-chilling details, venture forth to our official website [here](https://freakuencypodcast.wixsite.com/website).

Until we meet again, stay haunted!

Harshita C.

P.S. If you haven't already guessed, the spine-tingling name of our podcast is none other than "Freakuency".
