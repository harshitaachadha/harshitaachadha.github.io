UnClog aims to identify areas where waterlogging may take place using convolutional computer vision algorithms (CNN) and real-time imaging. A compiled list of flagged locations that is thus generated can help pre-warn the authorities about areas where there is a possibility of water accumulation. The project is now patented under the Australian Intellectual Property Authority.
