I am an MS in Computer Science student at George Washington University. My area of concentration is Machine Learning and Data Science. I will be graduating in May 2024 and am currently seeking internship or full-time opportunities.

I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from GGSIPU University in New Delhi, India where I gained expertise in core computer science subjects. On the academic research front, I collaborated with [Dr. Neelam Sharma](https://cse.mait.ac.in/index.php/people/faculty/profile?layout=edit&id=549){:target="_blank"} and her group to produce multiple original articles. My professional experience includes internships at renowned organizations such as Sanofi and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology of India. These roles have allowed me to work in diverse fields, ranging from the cloud and IoT (Internet of Things) to data science and artificial intelligence applications. In my junior year, I founded my own AI innovations lab - [Meraki](https://merakilab.co.in/){:target="_blank"}. The lab portfolio constitutes multiple patron-funded projects at various stages in the patent pipeline.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a strong passion for music. I play multiple instruments and sometimes compose unreleased diss tracks. I am an avid reader and constantly seek unconventional ways to learn new languages, such as immersing myself in popular culture and music.
