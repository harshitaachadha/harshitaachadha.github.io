From social media posts to the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, the contemporary world generates millions of terabytes of data each day. However, obscured behind this influx of modern-day big data, is the vast sea of unutilized information from history waiting to be analyzed to understand the evolution of society as we know it. Fortunately, a paradigm shift is now underway and many initiatives such as the digitization of ancient manuscripts, etc are underway to establish open-access archaeological data repositories.

The immense wealth of data accumulated over millennia is now becoming accessible, opening doors to a new frontier in archaeological research. Amidst this newfound availability of data, mining, and analysis techniques are increasingly being applied to uncover interesting insights, discern temporal trends, etc. This newly emerging field of archaeological data mining serves as a bridge between the wisdom of antiquity and the data-driven age, enriching our understanding of human history and culture in ways that were once unimaginable.

The objective of this term paper is to explore the impact of data mining techniques in archaeological research enhancement. To this effect, a detailed study of the various techniques and latest research presentations that utilize data mining to derive previously unknown insights from archaeological data was undertaken. Moreover, to demonstrate the applicability of data mining in the field of archaeology, three case studies are also presented.

This term paper examines the use of data mining techniques in archaeology, examining different approaches and how they may be applied to uncover insights from archaeological data that were not previously known. The content delves into collaborative aspects of interdisciplinary research and attempts to shed light on the broader implications of utilizing data mining in the field of archaeology, a practice that contributes to a nuanced understanding of societal structures and cultural exchange throughout history.

The contents of this article aim to capture the ongoing discourse of gaining insights into the past through the lenses of contemporary analytical frameworks as archaeological research ventures into new and exciting territories.
