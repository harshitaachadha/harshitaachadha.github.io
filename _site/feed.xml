&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey there, fellow thrill-seekers! Prepare yourselves for a spine-chilling revelation in this captivating post. Drumroll, please Introducing my wickedly exciting project for 2021: my very own podcast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the clock struck midnight in December 2020, a daring friend and I decided to unleash our inner eccentrics and embark on a podcasting adventure, delving into the bone-chilling realms that have captivated us for far too long. Brace yourselves, for this podcast, launching in April, shall become a sacred sanctuary for horror aficionados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behold the frequency of the freaks! We’ve planned to grace your ears once every fortnight, with an extra monthly treat to keep you on the edge of your seat. In our regular episodes, we shall regale you with tales of supernatural phenomena, haunted locations, true crime cases, and urban legends, among an endless list of thrilling topics. But wait, there’s more! Our bonus episodes shall dive deep into the dark abyss of Reddit, scouring for the most bloodcurdling and gory stories to narrate. And when the stars align, we’ll sprinkle in our own eerie encounters to spice things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you may be wondering how a science-minded soul like myself stumbled upon the supernatural labyrinth. Well, let me enlighten you. I grew up under the influence of a parent whose adoration for horror rivals that of Lorraine Warren herself. However, don’t mistake me for a true believer—I’m simply a masochistic enthusiast who enjoys sending shivers down my own spine, only to spend sleepless nights contemplating probabilities and jumping at the faintest of sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our episodes are crafted meticulously, ensuring they’re packed to the brim with bone-chilling content guaranteed to freeze you in terror. Clocking in at a tantalizing 20-25 minutes, they’ll leave you craving more. And fear not, for our podcast shall be available on all major streaming platforms, from Apple Podcasts to Buzzsprout and Spotify, granting you easy access to your darkest fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my fearless friends, we’ve reached the end of this unapologetically self-promoting post. All I implore you to do is give our podcast a chance, see if our eerie vibes resonate with your frequency (pun intended!). For further bone-chilling details, venture forth to our official website &lt;a href=&quot;https://freakuencypodcast.wixsite.com/website&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until we meet again, stay haunted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harshita C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you haven’t already guessed, the spine-tingling name of our podcast is none other than “Freakuency”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harshita Chadha</name><email>harshitachadha@gwmail.gwu.edu</email></author><category term="podcast" /><category term="horror" /><category term="mystery" /><summary type="html">Non-Tech Post Introducing &quot;Freakuency&quot; - A bone-chilling podcast for horror lovers, filled with supernatural tales, true crime cases, and the darkest urban legends.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Your Next Big Weekend Project</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/2021/01/projectguide/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Your Next Big Weekend Project" /><published>2021-01-23T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-01-23T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/2021/01/projectguide</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/2021/01/projectguide/">&lt;p&gt;Starting a new project can be quite challenging, especially when you’re struggling to come up with exciting ideas that truly ignite your enthusiasm. Luckily, I’ve always had a knack for brainstorming wild and wonderful concepts. Of course, being just one person, I can’t possibly pursue every single idea that pops into my head. That’s why I decided to write this article—to provide some much-needed inspiration for those of you who are currently facing a creative block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much deliberation, I’ve managed to compile a list of five fantastic ideas that are bound to get your creative juices flowing. Who knows, one of these ideas might just become the perfect weekend project for you. So, without further ado, let’s dive right in and explore these exciting possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The friend debt counter &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Now I know that money splitting apps are a dime a dozen on the app store and google play store alike but stay with me here a moment. What if instead of just splitting the funds, the app also keeps track of all the expenses you contribute when your friend group goes for an outing? I don’t know about you, but I have been in situations where I haven’t always had change to pay for my auto-rickshaw and one of my friends has swooped in to save the day. The app can help you keep track of all such little monetary nuances so that no one may call you a penny pincher the next time you decide to stop being the charity that serves cold coffees to aggrieved almost engineers. You could also maybe add a payment utility where all of your friends’ Paytm accounts can sync on one of the devices via some authentication and one account pays the establishment after collecting the split money from all accounts. Now that is stuff dreams are made of.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;h3&gt;A hospital suggester &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Now since I plan to pursue my master’s in applied machine learning, it should come as no surprise that I decided to drag my personal interests into this otherwise generic list. I came up with this idea while watching one of the wonderfully informative (insert eye roll) news channels of our country. One of the age-old arguments used by media to slander any law enforcement agency is the time delay that takes place during transportation of the victim to the hospital. This issue sadly is not just an argument but in reality, many grievances turn to fatalities due to time delays. This project works to alleviate this latency. Real-time traffic data from google maps can be accessed to take care of the choice of the optimum route. The real work is to create and integrate a utility at the end of hospitals. Each hospital may have a central system that tracks the number of empty beds in the emergency room and using Bluetooth technology, the number of available doctors at that instant. Machine learning can then be applied to make optimum hospital selection where guaranteed and quick help to the victim is provided. If this entire technology is concentrated into an application, it can be of immense use in case of accidents or medical emergencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;h3&gt;A songwriter/Composer AI &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This idea came to me while I was decorating my Christmas tree and was on the 3 millionth iteration of the same Christmas playlist. Since I have worked on creating AIs that can formulate fortunes/ horror stories when fed the right data, creating one that can come up with songs when fed a lyrical database shouldn’t be too difficult. The composer part may need some work. The composer section would require the model to be able to come up with a novel tune for the song that the lyricist part generates. Although it may sound pretty difficult, people have worked on this problem before. The article [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/01/how-to-perform-automatic-music-generation/) may serve as a beginner’s introduction to creating a tune-generating AI. With both components of the project down, you can go to town with generating hundreds of songs of whatever genre you want. Just try not to get caught up in intellectual property lawsuits!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;h3&gt;An app for quick CGPA reference &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Now I can’t speak for other colleges or universities, but the lack of centralized and reliable unofficial transcript generators for IPU students is the bane of my existence. Now, some online tools can be used to get semester wise results, but sadly they are pretty rudimentary with a very non-intuitive GUI. The CGPA reference app would need to create a central database by scraping the result data from the official IPU website which will not be that difficult because it is all publicly available as pdfs. The main part would be building an intuitive GUI which can serve as a quick reference for students when they are filling an internship application for the umpteenth time. One may also consider adding a CGPA converter that converts the CGPA from a 20.0 scale to a 4.0 one for all those poor souls who want to pursue higher education abroad.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;h3&gt;A portofolio website &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Seriously Harshita? This is what you’re thinking right now, isn’t it? I know. But trust me, however overused this project idea may be, it actually is quite beneficial in the long run. If you’re an engineer like me (well almost engineer anyway) then there may come a time when you have multiple projects that you have worked upon that really highlight your unique skillset. But since the resume you create should ideally be only one page long, you can’t include all of them on there. In such cases, it’s easier to have a website where you can showcase all your projects (maybe add cool demonstrations?). You don’t have to be into web development and create everything from scratch. If you’re a machine learning person like me (oh, how I hate CSS), you can make use of online tools like WordPress and Wix to create beautiful websites in a matter of hours. That is pretty neat in anyone’s book!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it! I am all out of ideas, for now anyway.

Zoltar is an artificial conversation entity that has the potential for both simplicity and tremendous growth. I’ll provide a brief overview of the project, its dependencies, and walk you through the main concepts involved in creating a conversational AI. Then, based on the knowledge gained, I’ll explain the technical workings of this project in detail. To conclude, I’ll share a video demonstrating a conversation I had with Zoltar. So, let’s dive right in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fortune Teller project, known as Zoltar, is an AI powered by a custom-made dataset created from subreddits and New York Times Horoscope Data. For simplicity, I chose to utilize Python’s NLTK package, which is well-suited for cloud-based environments. This project is completely data-driven, meaning that more data leads to better results. Now, let’s start from the beginning to understand what exactly an AI is and how it can engage in conversations without explicit programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is a sub-domain of data-driven computational practices that encompasses technologies like machine learning and deep learning. Back in 1955, Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, both pioneers of Artificial Intelligence, defined it as any task that, if performed by a human, would be considered an application of intelligence. While traditional data-driven domains like machine learning focus on learning from data and making predictions, AI aims to replicate human behavior with notable success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fortune-telling AI uses data to comprehend sentence structure and the words provided. To delve deeper into its functioning, let’s familiarize ourselves with a few key terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NLTK: Short for Natural Language Processing Toolkit, NLTK provides tools and functions for processing human language inputs. It is employed in various applications such as text classification, chatbots, sentiment analysis, and language translation. This is the main package used to build Zoltar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tokenization: Tokenization is the process of dividing large quantities of text into smaller parts called tokens. It consists of word and sentence tokenization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Word Tokenization: This operation is accomplished using the word_tokenize() function of NLTK, which splits a sentence into individual words.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sentence Tokenization: The sent_tokenize() module is used to obtain a list of sentences from a paragraph, enabling us to analyze average words per sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stemming: Stemming is a process of linguistic normalization that reduces words to their root form or chops off derivational affixes. For instance, words like “connection,” “connected,” and “connecting” are reduced to the common word “connect.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;POS Tagging: POS tagging identifies the grammatical group of a given word and looks for relationships within the sentence, assigning a corresponding tag to each word.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemmatization: Lemmatization reduces words to their base form, ensuring linguistically correct lemmas. It is usually more sophisticated than stemming, as it takes into account the context of the word. For example, “better” is lemmatized to “good.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop Words: Stop words are considered noise in text analysis. They are generic, repetitive, and irrelevant words that do not contribute significantly to the overall context. Removing stop words helps refine the data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a grasp of these fundamental concepts, let’s gain a technical overview of how Zoltar operates.The first step is to collect relevant data for training the model. I sourced New York Times fortune data from Kaggle and selected subreddits as data sources. Next, sentence and word lemmatization are performed to understand the data at its basic building units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this, irrelevant content such as stop words and punctuation marks are removed. Sentence vectorization is then used to group the stripped sentences into a bag-of-words model.The model is now ready to take user input and generate the most appropriate response by performing cosine similarity operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it! Your very own conversational AI, Zoltar, is now ready to hold stimulating conversations (well, not quite). To gain deeper insights into the project or try building it yourself, feel free to refer to the GitHub repository &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harshitaachadha/Zoltar-The-fortune-telling-AI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the code and data. As a bonus, I recorded a conversation I had with Zoltar and added some creepy music to set the ambiance. Enjoy the video!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;video controls=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the terms or the project itself, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m also open to discussing any improvements or additions you may have in mind for Zoltar.&lt;/p&gt;
