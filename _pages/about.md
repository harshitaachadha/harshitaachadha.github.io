<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am an MS in Computer Science student at George Washington University. My area of concentration is Data Science & Analytics. I will be graduating in May 2024 and am currently seeking full-time employment opportunities.
<br><br>
My specialty lies in crafting compelling narratives from complex data sources. Through my professional experiences at organizations such as Sanofi and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology of India, I have honed the ability to distill data into insightful stories that resonate with diverse audiences. As an aspiring data professional, I bring not only technical proficiency but also a passion for data-driven storytelling to the table.
<br><br>
In 2022, obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from GGSIP University in New Delhi, India. During this time, I also founded my own AI innovations lab - <a href="https://merakilab.github.io/"> Meraki</a>. The lab portfolio constitutes multiple patron-funded projects at various stages in the patent pipeline. Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a strong passion for music. I play multiple instruments and sometimes compose unreleased diss tracks. I am an avid reader and also constantly seek unconventional ways to learn new languages! <a href="/images/lang_viz.png">(Visualizing languages I can say üëãüèº in)</a>
